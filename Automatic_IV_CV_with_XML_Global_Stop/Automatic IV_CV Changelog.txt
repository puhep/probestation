-Made a separate subfolder for XML files
-Made CV scan skip sites that failed contact check for IV scan
-Changed File name for XML and .csv data file to simply contain the serial number of the scanned part
-Added parameter values (Bias polarity, Vlimit, Vstep, compliance level) to .csv data file for IV scan in the same manner as CV file
-Changed the Contact Check test voltage from 1 ---> 3 volts

V1.1:
